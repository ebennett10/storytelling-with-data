# Overview

Isabelle Leonaitis and I are looking at the 2015, 2016, and 2016 World Happiness Report data collected by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a group commissioned by UN. The WHR is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness and ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels and explain the variation through six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, social freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption. We mapped out the year over year change in happiness as well as stacked the countries and broke out the weight each variable played in the country's ranking. Then, we took this data and compared it to the International Telecommunication Union's 2016 data on the global percentage individual internet usage, as defined by country. With this comparison, we were trying to see if there is any correlation between internet usage and overall average happiness. The overall purpose of this exploration was to visual represent global happiness, show its change, and try and see if any of the variation could be explained by the internet which is influenced heavily by social media.

# Running the code

For this project we installed and ran Plotly's Python library within our Jupyter notebooks.

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.
